				'LGBTQ+ stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer. The ‚Äú+‚Äù signifies that one acronym can‚Äôt capture everyone‚Äôs experience of their gender identity or expression and/or sexual orientation. ‚ÄúQueer‚Äù is a word that historically has been used as a slur or insult against members of the LGBTQ+ community. In recent years, it has been reclaimed by the LGBTQ+ community to be an umbrella term for someone who is not heterosexual and/or cisgender.\nThe LGBT term is an adaptation of the initialism LGB, which began to replace the term gay in reference to the broader LGBT community beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s.When not inclusive of transgender people, the shorter term LGB is still used instead of LGBT.\nIt may refer to anyone who is non-heterosexual or non-cisgender, instead of exclusively to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. To recognize this inclusion, a popular variant, LGBTQ, adds the letter Q for those who identify as queer or are questioning their sexual or gender identity.'
