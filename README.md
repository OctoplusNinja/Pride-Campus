#### Requirements:
- [Discord Account](https://www.discord.com/login) :rocket:
- [Add to your discord server :globe_with_meridians:](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=990301006652928050&permissions=8&scope=bot+applications.commands)

#### Inspiration
We often wanted to explore Discord APIs as well since me and my teammates use Discord daily and being active in several communities has made us realise how important it is to tell new members how a community is built upon inclusive and diverse nature and that we should respect one's space around us whether we are in online or in offline mode. We ourselves took a long time to understand hence decided to make a bot which aware people about the same.

#### What it does:
- It responds to slash commands which are in [Features](#Features) section. 😮 

#### How do we build it?
- Falguni did UI/UX part along with functionalities. 🤞🏻 
- Aniruddha did NLP part with which the bot is gonna interact. :exploding_head:

#### Challenges we ran into -
> From '**Application not responding** to **Deployment**, we have understood how **important** every single line of code is.

#### Accomplishments that we're proud of
> We are now debugging gangsta.

#### What did we learn?
> Learnt a new stack and adapted it fully and quickly.

#### What's next for Pride Campus?
> As there were no API related to STEM opportunities specific to LGBTQ+ community, we used [Postman Mock API](https://blog.postman.com/lgbtq-pride-public-workspace-api-community/) for the same and if we can then we are planning to maintain a database for real job opportunities and updated from time to time.

#### Enjoy!

#### Built With:
- [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/)
- [Postman Mock API](https://blog.postman.com/lgbtq-pride-public-workspace-api-community/)
